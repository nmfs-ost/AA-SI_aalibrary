""""This script deals with the times associated with ingesting/preprocessing
    data from various sources. It works as follows:
    * A large file (usually 1 GB) is selected to repeatedly be downloaded and
        uploaded to a GCP bucket.
    * Download and upload times are recorded for each of these n iterations.
    * The average of these times are presented.
