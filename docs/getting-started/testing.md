# Let's Test üïµÔ∏è Our Code

Now that the library is installed, we can finally test it out. Open up a python  using the following command:

```bash
my-venv/bin/python
```

Next, we will enter the following code line-by-line. This will run a test function that will allow us to quickly test connectivity in our environment.

```python
from aalibrary import quick_test
quick_test.start()
```
