The Active Acoustics Strategic Initiative (AASI) aims to bring more data modernization to NOAA NMFS. This library is a data management tool that provides users with an all-in-one solution to load, transform, and analyze acoustics data from all science centers across the United States. Using the library, users now have the ability to:

<div align="left">
<ul>
  <li>Fetch data from disparate sources using a single source of retrieval, including being able to upload their personal data to the cloud.</li>
  <li>Cache repeatedly accessed data, optimizing data retrieval speeds.</li>
  <li>Transform and cache the transformed files, eliminating the need to constantly transform data before analysis.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Future plans include integration with more data sources, leading to petabytes of more data, and further integration with EchoPype. All together, the API provides users with a one-stop-shop for acoustics data. </br> </br>
